# Credit-card-fraud-detection
It is a ML model which predicts the Normal transaction and the fraudulent transactions.
So basically whenever we enter a credit card data, the data is preprocessed and then the insights or data analytics is generated. 
After this process the data is trained and test and the bugs or the faulty(noisy) data is removed.
Our model also prepares a logistics regression model to give the data a visual behavior. Thus then the model is evaluated.
Thus this helps in analysing the credit card data and detectiong fraud.

However, there are two possibility of error.
1) Overfitting - which is nothing but high training data accuracy and low test data accuracy
2) Underfitting - which is nothing but less training data accuracy and high test data accuracy

Both of these can create faults in the model.
